Smart Home Python App

This project is a prototype Smart Home App developed as part of a Python assignment. It features a GUI that interacts with smart devices such as SmartPlugs and Custom Smart Devices (e.g., SmartLights, SmartFridges). The app allows users to toggle devices, edit their properties, and control the smart home environment. Built using Python and Tkinter, this project demonstrates foundational concepts in object-oriented programming and graphical user interfaces.
